## 🔭 What am I working on?

In 2022, I became the team leader of the mobile team at [GetBridge](https://www.getbridge.com/) where I have worked as an engineer since 2019.

I'm constantly looking for ways to improve our processes and ensure the team is set up for success. I'm also committed to providing a safe, inclusive environment where everyone can do their most productive work. I'm passionate about helping my team members grow and reach their fullest potential.

### [Bridge: People Matter Most](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1451995049) 

It started as a greenfield 🌱 project.
Written in pure [Swift](https://swift.org/), with as few 3rd party dependencies as possible.
Tested extensively _(which I am very proud of)_ via Unit, UI and [Snapshot-tests](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-snapshot-testing/).

### [Career Drivers by Bridge](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1517025199)

It was born as a "HackWeek project" written in [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/). 
You can use this digital version of a card exercise to identify what drives your career.

## 🙇‍♂️ Keeping myself up-to-date

I place a great deal of importance on self-training. Blogs, conferences, newsletters, and GitHub notifications are my main sources of information.

Besides these, I have been a subscriber to [Point-Free](https://www.pointfree.co/) since 2021, and the content they provide is excellent.
