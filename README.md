# Hi, I'm Jozsef 👋👨‍💻,

I'm an enthusiastic iOS engineer _(with web and backend experience)_ who likes to work on challenging and innovative products while trying to make the world more user-friendly through accessibility & UX practices.

> As an iOS Developer I have strong experience in automation, testing, code review, and teamwork.  
I have far-reaching knowledge of architectural design and I'm on to deliver responsive, fast, and high-quality products respecting the platform, the design and the accessibility guidelines.

**My core responsibilities:**

- Strong iOS knowledge (Objective-C & Swift 2.2+)
- Familiarity with frontend (React, Flutter) and backend (NodeJS, Kotlin, PHP, Ruby) technologies
- I like to make scripts to make my own and others work easier
- Understanding of Apple's design principles and interface guidelines, as well as material guideline
- Knowledge of other web technologies and UI & UX standards
- Proficient understanding of code versioning tools
- Familiarity with CI/CD (Jenkins, Fastlane, Bitrise, Github Actions, Spinnaker)
- UX & Accessibility in mind
- I have a thorough knowledge of different design tools, like Figma and Sketch

## 🔭 I’m currently working on ...

### [Bridge: People Matter Most](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1451995049) 

Written in pure [Swift](https://swift.org/), uses as minimal 3rd party dependencies as it can. Started as a greenfield 🌱 project.  
Highly tested _(which I am very proud of)_ by Unit, UI and [Snapshot-tests](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-snapshot-testing/).
