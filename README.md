# Hi, I'm Jozsef 👋👨‍💻,

I'm an enthusiastic iOS engineer _(with web, backend and designing experience)_ who likes to work on challenging and innovative products while trying to make the world more user-friendly through accessibility & UX practices.

> As an iOS Developer, I have strong experience in automation, testing, code review, and teamwork.  
> I have far-reaching knowledge of architectural design. I like to deliver responsive, fast, and high-quality products that respect the  platform, design, and accessibility guidelines.

**Skills:**

- Strong iOS knowledge _(Objective-C & Swift 2.2+)_
- Familiarity with frontend _(React, Flutter)_ and backend _(NodeJS, Kotlin, PHP, Ruby)_ technologies
- I'm sort of a "script-kiddie" – I like to create scripts to make the work of myself and others easier
- Understanding of Apple's design principles and interface guidelines, as well as material guideline
- Knowledge of several web technologies
- UI/UX and Accessibility in mind
- Proficient understanding of code versioning tools
- Familiarity with CI/CD _(Jenkins, Fastlane, Bitrise, Github Actions, Spinnaker)_
- I have a thorough knowledge of different design tools, like Figma and Sketch

## 🔭 I'm currently working on ...

### [Bridge: People Matter Most](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1451995049) 

Written in pure [Swift](https://swift.org/), uses as minimal 3rd party dependencies as it can. Started as a greenfield 🌱 project.  
Highly tested _(which I am very proud of)_ by Unit, UI and [Snapshot-tests](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-snapshot-testing/).
